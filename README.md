Judging Ice coverage,  Step Sequences and Jump rotations with radical

On development starting on July 3rd  
No rough plans yet / for grad paper

!Messy draft down below!  

## Rough Draft
Some criteria that technician will judge: 
- Jump: Rotation, correct edge usage or not, coverage? perhaps??
- Spin: rotation?? not sure..
- Step sequences: for the past decade, this seems to be subjective comp by comp, athlete by athlete-> need to consider more about...

judge scenario: is he/she jump/spin/step? -> if jump rotation, correct edge? coverage? -> Judge GOE based on specific athelete's record

## Plans/Issues
- Rules change slightly season by season -> How are we gonna manage old data 
- Open pose -> check out papers
- Specify top athletes or objective data, or investigate..
- Update "project" category
